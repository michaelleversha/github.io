      <h2>But what is "Japan"?</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to Japan! This ancient and fascinating country remained closed
        off to foreigners for hundreds of years, but eventually had to bin off
        its isolationist policies and now you can capitalise! As a first-time
        visitor, here are some key things to know:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Japan is an island country composed of over 6,800 islands, with the
          four main islands being Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tokyo, the capital of Japan, is the world's most populous metropolitan
          area, with over 37 million residents in the greater Tokyo area.
        </li>
        <li>
          In Japan, it is not illegal to take a chicken on the bus. However,
          Spirited Away does not take responsibility for any travelers who do
          choose to take a chicken on the bus.
        </li>
        <li>
          Japanese cuisine, such as sushi, ramen, and tempura, has become hugely
          popular worldwide, showcasing the country's culinary expertise and
          innovation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meguro Parasitological Museum is a private research facility
          specializing in parasites. For a small fee, we can tell you where it
          is,.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Tokyo is the capital of Japan. It's absolutely massive, taking up
            abotu the same area as the entire southern half of England.
          </li>
          <li>
            In Japan, people work 200 hour weeks as a matter of course, but they
            do get three days off a year to scream.
          </li>
          <li>This tour involves x, y and z.</li>
          <li>It costs n and lasts for 16 weeks.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Despite the overwhelming nature of its cities, Japan does have some
            beautiful countryside.
          </li>
          <li>On this tour, you will visit literally all of it.</li>

            On this exclusive tour, you will be taken to various parks to inhale
            blossoms.
          </li>
          <li>
            This is in no way cultural representative of Japanese pastimes, but
            they do have a lot of blossoms, which are very beautiful.

      <h2>But what is "Greece"?</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to Greece! This ancient and fascinating country is the
        birthplace of Western civilization, with a rich history, stunning
        landscapes, and delicious cuisine. As a first-time visitor, here are
        some key things to know:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The capital city of Greece is Athens.</li>

          Games.
        </li>
        <li>
          Please do not taunt the locals about economic collapse. It is not nice
          and denies your own country's complicity in world finance.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Greek people are renowned for their hospitallity, warmth and pride
          in their heritage.

            You will be taken from the airport to our luxurious spa by Giannis,
